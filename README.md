# My Ludum Dare Entries

This repository is just a listing of code for the Ludum Dare entries I've submitted. You can feel free to take any of the code here under an MIT license, but I don't imagine it'd be of much use, given that the code for each game was written in 48 hours and by the less experienced self that existed in the past.
